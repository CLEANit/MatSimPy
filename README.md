This repo stores Python functions and classes that help materials science tasks with simulations.  Particularly for ASE and NetworkX, but also with VASP and (WIP) OVITO.  A number of these tools were found online and credit is given where possible.  If there are any items lacking suitable accreditation please let me know and I will correct them at once.
