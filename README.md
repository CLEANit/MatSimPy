Welcome to the MatSimPy documentation site, hosted by Github Pages.

This site stores Python functions and classes that help with materials science simulations, particularly for work involving ASE, NetworkX, VASP, and OVITO (WIP).  A number of these tools were adapted from resources shared online and credit is given where possible.  If there are any items lacking suitable attributation please let me know and I will correct them at once.

Please see the new GitHub Pages [site](https://cleanit.github.io/MatSimPy/).
