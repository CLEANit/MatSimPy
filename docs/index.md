Welcome to the MatSimPy documentation site, hosted by Github Pages. This site is a work-in-progress, I hope you enjoy it nonetheless.

This repo stores Python functions and classes that help materials science tasks with simulations.  Particularly for ASE and NetworkX, but also with VASP and (WIP) OVITO.  A number of these tools were found online and credit is given where possible.  If there are any items lacking suitable accreditation please let me know and I will correct them at once.




Todo Buildnotes 17/07/2024:
* [ ] Update syntax for markdown to distinguish each function
* [ ] Shuffle documentation from main index to designated pages
* [ ] Update to PEP 8 standards
* [ ] Add section heading 'Documentation' to navbar
