Welcome to the MatSimPy documentation site.

This site stores Python functions and classes that help with materials science simulations, particularly for work involving ASE, NetworkX, VASP, and OVITO (WIP).  A number of these tools were adapted from resources shared online and credit is given where possible.  If there are any items lacking suitable attributation please let me know and I will correct them at once.

This site continues to be updated with new functions and examples, with the most recent update on: 2025-01-09.
