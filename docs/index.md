This repo stores Python functions and classes that help materials science tasks with simulations.  Particularly for ASE and NetworkX, but also with VASP and (WIP) OVITO.  A number of these tools were found online and credit is given where possible.  If there are any items lacking suitable accreditation please let me know and I will correct them at once.

TODO:
* [ ] Update syntax for markdown to distinguish each function
* [ ] Shuffle documentation from main index to designated pages
* [ ] Update to PEP 8 standards
      
## Documentation:

### plots.py    -->    Matplotlib & Seaborn plotting
TBD
